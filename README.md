# JS-Workshop-3

A set of JavaScript exercises covering loops, random number generation, array operations, string handling, and object traversal. The tasks include converting user input, finding specific courses, generating even numbers with loops, creating unique random arrays, and identifying minimum and maximum values manually.

## 📚 Overview

This repository contains a series of small vanilla JavaScript exercises meant to help you practise and master fundamental JS concepts.  

The goal is to:  
- Reinforce understanding of loops, conditionals, arrays, strings, and objects  
- Practice manual data manipulation (e.g. finding min/max, building arrays with constraints)  
- Gain familiarity with plain HTML + JavaScript interaction in a browser  

If you’re new to JavaScript or want to sharpen your basics — this is for you.

## 🛠️ Technologies

- HTML  
- Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)

## 📂 Project Structure

✅ What’s included / Exercises Summary

Converting and processing user input

Filtering and searching arrays / course lists

Generating sequences (like even numbers) using loops

Creating arrays with unique random values

Finding minimum and maximum values/manually traversing arrays/objects

String handling and manipulation

💡 Why this project

This workshop-style repo helps reinforce core JavaScript knowledge in a hands-on way. Rather than relying on libraries or frameworks, it encourages you to build solutions in plain JS, giving you a stronger foundation. It’s ideal for beginners, students, or anyone brushing up on fundamentals.

📈 Possible Improvements / Future Ideas

Add more exercises covering advanced topics (e.g. asynchronous code, DOM manipulation, events)

Add tests (e.g. using a JS testing library) to verify solutions automatically

Extend functionality — build small demo apps using the exercise modules

Add a “solutions” branch or alternate files with commented, production-ready solutions
